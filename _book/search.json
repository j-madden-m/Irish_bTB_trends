    "text": "Background\nDRAFT DOCUMENT\nThis is an accompanying website to supplement a paper submitted to journal XXX. The purpose of this supplementary website is to have a semi-live version of the output of the paper after it has been published (once new data becomes available). It also acts as a location to include excess output that didn’t make it into the main paper but which we think is still useful for readers. Additional analysis will be added over time.\nINCLUDE paper reference here\nThe paper highlights various trends from different components of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) eradication programme in Ireland (from 2008 onwards). This includes cattle population demographics, herd enterprise types, bTB case numbers, herd-level bTB breakdowns, lesion detection at slaughter inspections both in bTB positive animals and routinely slaughtered animals. The data used has been obtained from the Irish national bTB eradication programme (Animal Health Computer System (AHCS) (Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM)), Animal Identification and Movement System (AIM), Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)), which included results from herd-level skin tests, animal-level laboratory tests (from animals with suspect bTB lesions) and the animal-level IFN-γ blood tests. It has been processed by Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis CVERA for research purposes and as a result, there may be minor discrepancies between DAFM output and ours. A bTB eradication timeline is also included which highlights some of the major trials and policy and diagnostic changes introduced during the programme.",

This encompasses publications that may not be directly from CVERA (e.g., where CVERA member is only a co-author on the publication, the list also includes publications from the Tuberculosis Diagnostics & Immunology Research Laboratory in UCD).",

We acknowledge there is a strong spatio-temporal distribution of bTB in Ireland but exploring spatial trends is not the focus of this particular work. For a recent spatial analysis of bTB trends in Ireland, see Madden et al. and for a more current spatial exploration of bTB, see here. There is also no analysis included on age-specific bTB trends - that is a separate piece of work that is ongoing. Time-series analysis will be included in future work.",

There was no facility within AHCS prior to May 2019 to record IFN-γ positive animals. Before this, if an animal had a positive IFN-γ result, their SICTT results were reinterpreted as positive. As a result, we have had to use old raw IFN-γ data to try and differentiate between which animals were positive on IFN-γ or SICTT. The old data has some missing tag numbers etc. and so we cannot be certain that we have assigned all cases to either IFN-γ or SICTT correctly. However, we believe, the vast majority of the data is correct. Note, currently, we seem to be missing some lesions for Dec 2023. (awaiting new data dump)\nThis is the difference between overall lesion prevalence document and this one (i.e. we make an attempt to seperate SICTT and IFN-γ positive trends).",

Any animal with a permit will get a visual inspection for lesions. In rare instances, a bTB positive animal may be sent to a knackery instead of an abattoir or meatplant (e.g. if the animal dies before being sent to the factory). In these cases, a permit may not be issued and a visual inspection does not routinely take place in a knackery. For these reasons, only animals with a permit (and thus, a visual check completed) are considered for this document.\nOf all SICTT and IFN-γ positive animals, this is the breakdown of the number of animals with a permit:\n\n\n per_type      n      percent valid_percent\n     ER26 275450 0.8541270663  0.8766737004\n    ER26A   2083 0.0064590549  0.0066295564\n    ER26B    245 0.0007597064  0.0007797606\n    ER26D    193 0.0005984626  0.0006142604\n  ER26GIF  25837 0.0801164676  0.0822313247\n    ER26R    281 0.0008713367  0.0008943377\n    ER26S   9513 0.0294983147  0.0302769901\n ER26SGIF    597 0.0018512030  0.0019000697\n     &lt;NA&gt;   8294 0.0257183877            NA\n\n\nOf importance here is that ER26GIF and ER26SGIF permits refer to IFN-γ bTB positive animals.

    "section": "5.7 Notes",
    "text": "5.7 Notes\nWhy would lesions in head/chest be increasing? - change in way recording is done? - differences between factories? - A very small minority might specialise in kosher meats and so may inspect animals differently but unlike to have an effect nationally\nWe might expect dairy might have higher lesion rates than beef herds (intensification hypothesis of dairy herds) - why dont we see this? - possible age effects in dairy? Might need to stratify by age/sex\nReplicate above for bTB cases\nFrom DAFM:\nWhat are the average lesion detection rates? - 30% of skin test reactors will have visible lesions at post-mortem inspection. - 15% of Gamma Interferon reactors will have visible lesions at post-mortem inspection. (This figure relates to cattle, in herds with high risk breakdowns, which are in the same groups as cattle that were skin test reactors).\nBiology of lesion trends\n\nHealthy lesion rate seems to mirror reactor lesion rate (previous chapter) which suggests, these are not historic infections but relatively new?\nWhy were levels high in 2008? It seems to be the peak of that cycle at the time and then there was a serious effort to clean-up the whole system (concerted effort): there were focused investigations, hot-spots were priortised (e.g., Monaghan), fraud cases were investigated, the quality control programme was brought in, SICTT & PVP training was increased/introduced, there was much more awareness to look out for lesions due to the ongoing gamma trial at the time etc. IFN-γ rates were up around 30% indicating that we were missing lots of infection at the time. This may also partly explain why chest prevalence was high back in 2008 - we were missing lots of infection and it had seeded in animals.\nDifference in proportion of chest vs head lesions. Not seeing a difference in beef/sucklers but are in dairy - suggests this is real effect? The increase in chest compared to head in dairy is consistent with increased immunosuppression. bTB is a chest disease, if an animal is stressed it will stay in the lungs (before eventually spreading around the body when it has reached a more advanced stage). If an animal is immunosuppressed, they won’t initially get multiple lesions - which seems counter intuitive. Their immune system is not competent enough to disseminate the disease around the body. More stress = more chest involvement. If you get more lung infection, you get more transmission.\nWhy is the “multiple lesions” group decreasing? This may be related to the improvement in detection since 2008 which may also mean earlier detection. Multiple lesions are a reflection of more advanced infection but we are generally detecting bTB at an early stage now with tighter testing quality (QA programme and IFN-γ etc.).\nWhat is ideal weather for mbovis? - probably warm, moist soil. Mild, damp rather than dry.\nRe: the lesions, they could take six months to develop, so the later summer lesion profile could well reflect infection dynamics the previous March\n\nPolicy:\n\nI wonder would it be worth considering additionally testing for herds with a lot of chest detections (round of IFN-γ testing)? Or even herds with animals with multiple lesions (more advanced infection)? I am checking the data on this\n\nQuestions/ideas to explore\n\nWhats interesting is that dairy seem to send animals primarily to slaughter at the start of the year (presumably during drying period?) but have the most lesions presented at slaughter in the 2nd half of the year. Perhaps these lesioned animals come from a subset of dairy herds who are not spring calving herds?\nwhy do we see a clean, consistent seasonal effect of an increase in lesion prevalence later in the year?\nDoes it suggests that there a cohort of riskier herds, that send their animals to slaughter later in the year (and perhaps, do not send animals earlier in the year and so we miss their infections)- I need to check this.\nChange in sensitivity by time of year? Or is it related to previous point, that riskier herds are just not sending their animals at that time? Or, they are not riskier per se, but as they don’t have a round test earlier in the year, earlier infections are not detected after winter housing and infection is allowed to seed in the animals and lesions form.\nIs there a difference in BD size between a herd with more chest vs head vs multiple lesions? Hypothesis here is that herds with more multiple lesions/chest, may have more advanced disease and increased likelihood of having more/missed infection. I need to check this.\nIt would be really interesting to get the age profile of these – I will do these at some stage for my age work anyway but it will just take a bit of work. What we are seeing could be a certain aged animal that tends to get sent to slaughter later in the year.\nIs there a reporting bias? Does inspection start at head?\nRedo to include Brock sub-classes: may help tease out which herds are sending animals at later time of year\n\nFollow-up on lesion detection/inspection biases\n\nUsually two VIs in the factory who act in a supervisory role. Temporary VI (TVIs) do the inspections and there are usually 4 TVIs working at one time. TVIs are usually private vets who do this as additional work. You have to be a vet to do meat inspection in Ireland (although this might not be the rule in other countries?)\nProcess of inspection\nThe crucial piece of information is that (at least in this factory but should be similar in others) different body parts go to different people for inspection so one TVI will not inspect the whole body of one animal.\nEach animal is distributed into 4 separate process lines:\n\nHead\nPluck (lung, chest)\nBelly (intestines etc?)\ninspection of the split carcass (carcass hoisted up)\n\nTVIs will be stationed at one of these lines for the duration of their shifts but will probably rotate lines between shifts (e.g. so one TVI would not always be stationed on the head line)\nIn this particular factory head and pluck lines were close together so the TVIs could theoretically talk to each other but more than likely that the inspection is independent\nMultiple lesions (MLs): need to clarify if this means multiple lesions within the one station (so a TVI spots multiple lesions in the head line) or does it mean lesions were spotted in multiple body part locations. Wasn’t sure if ML is assigned by TVI on their line of at the end of all the stations. I suppose it could be a mixture of both?\nIn general, TVIs have moved away from diagnosing a lesion as mbovis (in healthy animals), any suspect lesion is generally just sent to the laboratory for testing\n\nReactor inspections (animals classified as bTB before entering factory via SICTT or GIF)\n\nIn this factory, reactors were inspected at a different time to the healthy animals (e.g. altogether after lunch). TVIs were told that these were reactor animals. The lines were slowed down a little bit (compared to healthy animal) which naturally gave them a small bit more of a thorough inspection. In terms of detecting lesions, naturally, there may be some confirmation bias at play here already knowing that they were reactor animals?",

In the situation when a BD started due to the detection of a visible lesion, we chose the start date as the date when the sample was sent to the lab and not the date in which it was identified as culture positive which could be a number of weeks later. Depending on the circumstances, the herds trading_status on AHCS will generally change from free to withdrawn/suspended. We defined the BD end date as the date of the next SICTT (whole herd) test where the trading_status was restored to free. Once a bTB case is detected, a herd will usually remain in a BD until it has had two consecutive, clear whole-herd SICTT tests (usually 60 days apart). There are certain exceptions to the above criteria e.g., singletons.\nThere were rare instances when a herd was in a BD based on trading status but it did not have a bTB case (these could be for awhole host of reasons including fraud investigations (so a herd may be in suspended mode although no cases), error on system etc.). Of all BDs after 2007 (n = 74533), there were only 574 of these zero case BDs (0.77%).

The variance in the number of cases within BDs is also increasing within dairy. Mixed herd-types are also increasing in size (these are herds that have a component of their herd as dairy).
